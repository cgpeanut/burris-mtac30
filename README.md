# burris
Match your cartridge (or closest equivalent) to get a good idea of where your shot will fall, using each of the reticle hash marks. For example, if you are using the Gen 3 reticle, with a 5.56 62-grain round, your bullet will fall at 100 yards for each hash mark. If you use a 55-grain round, the bullet will drop more after 500 yards: instead of hitting 1,000 yards with the lowest hash mark, you'll be at 935 yards.
